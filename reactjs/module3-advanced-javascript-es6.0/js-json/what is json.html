what is json ? JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data
interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for
machines to parse and generate. It is primarily used to transmit data between a
server and a web application as an alternative to XML. JSON is
language-independent, meaning it can be used with many programming languages,
including JavaScript, Python, Java, and more. It represents data as key-value
pairs and supports various data types such as strings, numbers, arrays, objects,
and booleans. JSON syntax is simple and consists of two main structures: 1.
**Objects**: An unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces
`{}`. Keys are strings, and values can be any valid JSON data type. Example:
```json { "name": "John", "age": 30, "isStudent": false } ``` { "employee":[ {
"name": "John", "age": 30, "isStudent": false }, { "name": "Jane", "age": 25,
"isStudent": true }, { "name": "Doe", "age": 40, "isStudent": false }, { "name":
"Alice", "age": 28, "isStudent": true } ] }
