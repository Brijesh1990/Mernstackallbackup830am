/* what is array : 

array is a simple variables whare stored multiple data in a single variable.

it is a collection of items that can be of any type, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.

it is a data structure that allows you to store and manipulate a list of values.

it is a special type of object that allows you to store and manipulate a list of values.

it is a collection of items that can be of any type, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.

 it is a data structure that allows you to store and manipulate a list of values.

types of array:
1. Indexed Array: An array where each element is accessed by a numeric index, starting from 0.
2. Associative Array: An array where each element is accessed by a string key, rather than a numeric index. (Note: In JavaScript, associative arrays are actually objects.) 
3. Multidimensional Array: An array that contains other arrays as its elements, allowing for the creation of complex data structures like matrices or tables.

var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // Indexed Array
var arr2 = {name: "John", age: 30}; // Associative Array (Object in JavaScript)
var arr3 = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]; // Multidimensional Array

// Example of an Indexed Array
var fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
// Accessing elements in an Indexed Array
console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: apple    

// Example of an Associative Array (Object in JavaScript)

var person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};

// Accessing elements in an Associative Array
console.log(person.name); // Output: John

// Example of a Multidimensional Array
var matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
];

// Accessing elements in a Multidimensional Array
console.log(matrix[1][2]); // Output: 6
